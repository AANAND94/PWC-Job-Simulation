PWC Job Simulation

Task 1
Call Centre Analysis for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior.

Possible KPIs include:
â–ª Overall customer satisfaction
â–ª Overall calls answered/abandoned
â–ª Calls by time
â–ª Average speed of answer
â–ª Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Insights as per KPI(s)
â–ª Overall Customer Satisfaction
â€” High satisfaction rates indicate customer problems being resolved effectively, which leads to superior agent performance.
â€” Low satisfaction rates may indicate where training or process changes, and even product enhancements are required.

â–ª Total Calls Answered/Abandoned
â€” High abandonment rates may indicate the need for additional staff at peak times or more efficient call routing.
â€” Consistent high answered call rates suggest that staffing levels are good, and the right processes for dealing with inbound calls in a productive way.

â–ª Calls by Time
â€” Support scheduling and staffing decisions, especially during peak hours to ensure proper coverage.
â€” Can help educate patterns and insights into what additional resources or other modes of support might be required.

â–ª Average Speed of Answer
â€” Drive more positive customer experience by allowing customers to complete feedback without waiting, due faster processing.
â€” Slow ASA â€” An unprompted high-level report that you may be understaffing or have routing problems.

â–ª Agentâ€™s performance quadrant (Avg Handle time vs Calls Answered â€” Agent Performance Quadrant)
â€” High(AHT), High Calls Answered: These agents are productive but may need some help in lowering handle times without necessarily giving up on quality.
â€” High (AHT), Low Calls Answered: While this may just suggest a need for additional training or resources, it could also be an indication of agents being overwhelmed with complex call types and not knowing how to handle them.
â€” Low AHT, High Calls Answered: (These agents are the best, they work quickly and you can call them as many times as possible).

These insights can be used to implement targeted improvements, optimize resources, and enhance overall customer service.


Task 2
Churn Analysis

Possible KPIs included:
â–ª Services each customer has signed up for like (phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech)
â–ª Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
â–ª Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
